onway's Game of Life This project is a C-based implementation of Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of patterns on a grid based on mathematical rules. The source code is organized within a structured environment where the core logic resides in the src/ directory, with main.c serving as the primary entry point. The system includes a robust utility for parsing external input files via a parse_life() function, allowing for the simulation of well-known Life constructions found in the inputs/ folder. To ensure accuracy, the project features a validation system that compares generated states against reference data in the outputs/ directory using a make test command. The build process is managed by a modular Makefile, which allows for easy expansion of the source code by registering new files within the SOURCEFILES variable.
